## 1. Distribution of Employees Across Teams

+ The distribution revealed that some teams have a higher number of employees than others.
+ For example, Team A has the most employees, indicating its critical role within the company, while Team C has fewer employees, possibly pointing to its niche or specialized nature.
+ Actionable Insight: The imbalance in team sizes may affect inter-departmental workload and efficiency. Management could evaluate the staffing needs of smaller teams.

## 2. Segregation of Employees by Position

+ Employees are distributed across various positions, with some roles being more prominent (e.g., junior developers or senior managers).
+ Certain positions dominate specific teams, indicating specialization within the workforce.
+ Actionable Insight: The company can review whether there is a need to diversify positions within underrepresented roles or increase hiring in areas with high workloads

## 3. Predominant Age Group

+ The 20-29 age group is the largest, making up a significant percentage of the workforce. This suggests that the company employs a younger demographic, possibly reflecting a focus on entry-level roles or early-career employees.
+ The smaller representation of older age groups may indicate fewer senior professionals or managers.
+ Actionable Insight: Management could investigate retention programs for experienced employees or mentorship opportunities to maintain workforce balance.

## 4. Team and Position with the Highest Salary Expenditure

+ Team B and senior management positions contribute the most to salary expenditure. This reflects the higher pay scales typically associated with managerial and specialized roles.
+ Teams with the highest salary budgets might also correlate with their strategic importance or higher levels of seniority.
+ Actionable Insight: The company could examine whether salary expenditure aligns with productivity and team outcomes to ensure optimal resource allocation.

## 5. Correlation Between Age and Salary

+ A moderate positive correlation was observed between Age and Salary, indicating that older employees generally earn higher salaries due to seniority and experience.
+ However, there are outliers where younger employees earn higher-than-average salaries, possibly in specialized roles.
+ Actionable Insight: Management could evaluate outliers to ensure equity in pay scales while rewarding high performance.
